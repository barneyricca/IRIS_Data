These files process the EMA, audio, and Fitbit data for the IRIS project.

The data are NOT included here; they must be acquired separately, although these files give the process for doing that. (All data are password protected, so you will need passwords and authorization.)

Additionally, there is a file that links the rsp_id, IRIS_id, and mobile code for participants; that will need to be acquired separately as well.

These scripts are very much "in progress" so you can rely on them changing.
